### Goal and Value of the Application
A web store for buying clothes

### Usability Principles Considered
My application provides two filtering categories to cater for buyers that are allergic to Gluten and Diary products.
My application also provides a way to sort through displayed products by price. You can see the pricer options first or the cheaper options first
This sorting works with filtering as well, so you can filter to see products containing gluten then sort by price.
My application also provided a dynamic cart that visually populates as you add items and accumulates the total price. There is also an intuitive remove button beside each item, which deletes an item from your cart and deducts its contribution to your total price.
Finally there is an All filter which acts as a reset button, allowing you to see all items in the inventory.
